# ðŸ’° CryptoReact

**CryptoReact** is a real-time dashboard showing the top 120 cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap.com

Built as a weekend project, this was a great play around to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io). 
This project has been inspired by [CryptoVue](https://www.cryptovue.com/),
basically the same project, but made in Vue.JS. You can reach [me on github](https://github.com/xunga) or reach the [creator](https://github.com/djirdehh) of CryptoVue on [this github repo](https://github.com/djirdehh/crypto_vue).
