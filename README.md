# ðŸ’° CryptoReact

**CryptoReact** is a real-time dashboard showing the top 120 cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap.com

Built as a weekend project, this was a great play around to [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io). 
This project has been inspired by [CryptoVue](https://www.cryptovue.com/),
basically the same project, but made in Vue.JS. You can reach me on github or reach the creator of CryptoVue on this github repo.

## How to use

- Clone the repo
- `$ cd cryptoReact`
- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start`

Your browser should pop up and you are ready to go ðŸš€
